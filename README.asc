Sandscape
=========

Sandscape is no longer actively maintained.

Sandscape is a browser-based implementation of a CCG being developed as part 
of the [Wtactics project](http://wtactics.org). It offers the player the 
basic tools for creating a CCG game, without forcing any rules on the actual 
game being played.

Along side the basic playing field, SandScape has the usual user management
system, which requires valid authentication in order to play, a lobby system
where players can see each other and arrange games and simple statistics
recording.

No artificial intelligence was implemented in the platform nor are there any 
plans to implement game rules.

Development and Installation
----------------------------

To install or develop the platform you'll need access to an Apache Web Server 
or an NGINX installation, PHP and, at the moment, shell/console access. To play 
a game you only need a recent browser, either Firefox, Opera, Google Chrome or 
Microsoft Edge (currenly not tested, but should work);

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Apache Web Server;
- PHP 5.5+;
- MySQL 5.1+;
- Composer, for automatic installs and development

Install
~~~~~~~

Installing Sandscape is a step only users interested in having their own server
instance should take. You *don't* need to have Sandscape installed in order 
to play, the software is installed in a server and accessed using a browser.

//TODO: Complete install process with composer and manual installation steps.
